            The strict equality operator <code>(===)</code> checks to see if two
            values are equal, and returns a Boolean result <code>true</code> if
            the values are equal and <code>false</code> if the values are not
            equal.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using
            conditional statements such as <code>if</code> statements allows us to
            interrupt control flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            When creating an <code>if</code> statement, we provide one or more
            conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy,
            the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly
            brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not
            execute, interrupting the control flow. Interrupting the control flow
            in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions
          </li>
          <li>
            An <b>array</b> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            A single <b>array</b> can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an <b>index</b>. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <code>for</code> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional <code>if</code> statement that we just learned, to interrupt the <b>control flow</b> by executing a block of code a specific number of times.
          </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>
            We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named <code>length</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Math.floor()</code> and <code>Math.random()</code> are both properties of JavaScript's built-in <code>Math</code> object that can be used together to generate a random number.
          </li>
          <li>Functions are the building blocks of JavaScript.</li>
          <li>
            When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            To execute a function, we must call it in our code.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is also important to remember that since control flow dictates that JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order matters.
